# 🏦 Razorpay Activation & Website Details Guide

Razorpay will **NOT** let you accept live payments until you complete the **Activation Form** and they approve your website.

## ✅ Phase 1: Add Website Details in Dashboard

1.  **Log in** to [Razorpay Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/).
2.  Look for the **"Activate Account"** button (usually at the top right or in the left sidebar under "My Account").
3.  Navigate to **Business Website/App Details**.
4.  **Fill in the following:**
    *   **Website/App URL:** `https://tripsang.com`
    *   **Business Type:** Select accurate type (e.g., "Proprietorship", "Individual", etc.).
    *   **Business Category:** "Travel & Tourism" or "E-commerce".
    *   **Description:** "A community platform for travelers to plan trips and find travel buddies."

## ⚠️ Phase 2: CRITICAL - Mandatory Website Pages

Razorpay **Strictly Requires** the following pages to be visible on your website footer. If these are missing, your application will be **Rejected**.

You must have:
1.  **Contact Us** (`/contact`)
    *   Must show: Phone number, Email ID, and Registered Office Address.
2.  **Terms & Conditions** (`/terms`)
3.  **Privacy Policy** (`/privacy`)
4.  **Refund & Cancellation Policy** (`/refund-policy`)
    *   Must clearly state: "No refunds" or "Refunds processed within 5-7 days".

> **🚨 Check:** I searched your project content and **did not find these pages**.
> **You usually cannot go live without them.**

## ✅ Phase 3: Submit for Review

1.  Once the details are filled and documents (PAN, Aadhar, Bank Proof) are uploaded.
2.  Click **Submit Form**.
3.  Wait 2-3 days for the status to change to **"Activated"**.

### 💡 Do you want me to create these legal pages for you?
I can generate standard `Terms`, `Privacy`, `Refund`, and `Contact` pages for `tripsang.com` right now so you can deploy them and get approved.
